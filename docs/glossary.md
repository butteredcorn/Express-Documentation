| Term        | Definition           |
| ------------- |-------------|
| **Application Programming Interface (API)**     | A third party service that hosts HTTP end points to receive and send data typically in the form of JSON. |
| **Dependency Injection**     | The ability for the software or code that calls a function or object to pass in arguments, such as an argument for a database or a port number to start up a server. The idea behind dependency injection is to break down code into modular bits that do not depend on code that is not essential to its core function. This makes the application easier to debug and test.      |
| **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)** | A file format used for data exchange. Data is stored and transmitted as key/value pairs. |
| **Magic Numbers** | Specific values that have some sort of context and are used (repeatedly) in code, but are not given context and should be replaced with constants. |
| **Route** | A route is a particular end point that handles that specific HTTP request. A route can have more than one function that handles the routing process. |
 | **Routing** | Routing refers to how your application handles HTTP requests. |
 | **Views** | A type of file that can be rendered to HTML. Such file extensions include Embedded JavaScript (EJS), Handlebars, and React. |
 | **View Engine** | A module or library that is responsible for rendering HTML from views. Typically a combination of HTML plus a programming language. |
